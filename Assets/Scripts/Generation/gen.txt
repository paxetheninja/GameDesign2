Before starting generation: randomly determine # of rooms

Genes:
    - Gene expression for each room separately
        - Connected to customer room?
        - Room division (no division, 2-way division)
        - # of player spawns
        - Size - expressed by 2 genes for X and Y direction
    - Connectivity mode (no doors, one-way doors, circular doors, two-way connectivity)

Selection:
    Hard requirements:
   // - 1 customer room
    - >2x larger grid than space workstations use
    - All unique workstations present at least once
    - total # of player spawns has to be equal to # of players
    - division mode must adhere to certain rules:
        - total number of room divisions can't be > # of players
            i.e. 2 rooms with 2-way splits possible for 4 but not 3 players
        - rooms must be large enough to fit divisions
            - 2-way split: length along the split axis at least 6 (2 wall tiles, 2 tables, 1 door)
    
    Soft requirements:
    - 
    - Difficulty factors (1, 2, 3):
        - Number of individual workstations (fewer -> harder)
        - Uniqueness of workstation set in room (does 1 room have all workstations?)
        
Generation phase:
    - Unique player spawns and workstation placement (avoid collisions)
